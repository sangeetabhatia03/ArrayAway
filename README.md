# ArrayAway
This is a HTML5 game developed with the open source software GDevelop. The game is based on the problem of rearrangement of genomes via large scale rearrangement events such as inversion.
The objective of this game is to arrange the top row of cars like the bottom row in the smallest number of moves. A move is selecting two cars (from left to right) by clicking (left click) on them.
This will flip around the section of cars between the selected cars. This ``flipping'' action is analogous to an inversion event in genomes.
